# Learn C
This repository contains *many* exercises, at beginner to confirmed (I personally think).
All exercises come from the book **"The language C"** by Brian W.KERNIGHAN & Dennis M.RITCHIE.
The exercises will be translated in two languages : French & English.
But all commentary is in **english**, use [Deepl](www.deepl.com) and [Wordreference](www.wordreference.com) if it needed.

> At the moment, not all exercises/chapters are finished, they will be added as they become available.

> [!TIP]
> Do the exercises yourself by following the instructions. If you can't do them, look at the solutions provided here, but don't copy them. It's > by coding that you become a coder... at least, I think that's how the saying goes.
> Good luck, everyone! May the C be with you.
